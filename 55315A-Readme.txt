*****   Class Delivery   ***** 
55315A is designed to help those new to databases to learn the fundamentals of creating and working with relational database objects.
It has a modular design allowing the lab exercises to be taught in any order the trainer chooses.  This also allows customized deliveries of the material in combination with other Azure, PowerShell or database classes.  
For additional help in configuring standard or customized deliveries, please read the Trainer Preparation Guide (55315A-ENU_TrainerPreparationandNotes.pdf) or contact the author at (neil@neiltucker.biz).

Licensing:
The training center or any organization hosting the lab computers for this class are fully responsible for the licensing of all software used in the course and labs. 
An Azure deployment of the class may make this process easier.

Note:
Exercises using Azure Data Studio can be substituted with Visual Studio Code.  There is a new demonstration in Module 1 to show how most ADS exercises can be ported over to VS Code.
